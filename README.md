## Introduction

The purpose of this challenge is to be able to create a script that analyzes the provided datasets and is able to calculate specifed values.


## Getting Started

Prior to execution, you must have Python as well as VSCode installed. You must also have the necessary csv files downloaded.


## Build Process

PyBank analysis on records:
- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

Your analysis should align with the following results:

PyPoll analysis on votes:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your analysis should align with the following results:

## Considerations

- Try to break down your tasks into discrete mini-objectives.
- The datasets for these Challenges are quite large, but creating scripts in Python can provide us with more powerful options for handling big data.
- Write one script for each of the provided datasets. Run each script separately to make sure that the code works for its respective dataset.
- Always commit your work and back it up with pushes to GitHub or GitLab. You don't want to lose hours of your hard work!
