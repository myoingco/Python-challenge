## Introduction

The purpose of this challenge is to be able to create a script that analyzes the provided datasets and is able to calculate specifed values.


## Getting Started

Prior to execution, you must have Python as well as VSCode installed. You must also have the necessary csv files downloaded.


## Build Process

PyBank analysis on records:
- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

Your analysis should align with the following results:

PyPoll analysis on votes:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your analysis should align with the following results:

## Considerations

- Try to break down your tasks into discrete mini-objectives.
- The datasets for these Challenges are quite large. This was done purposefully to showcase one of the limits of Excel-based analysis. As data analysts, our first instinct is often to go straight to Excel, but creating scripts in Python can provide us with more powerful options for handling big data.
- Write one script for each of the provided datasets. Run each script separately to make sure that the code works for its respective dataset.
- Always commit your work and back it up with pushes to GitHub or GitLab. You don't want to lose hours of your hard work! Also make sure that your repo has a detailed README.md file.
